## Project

A project is a real-world infrastructure or development activity that is in need of tailored climate advice or concrete climate change adaptation measures in from of Climate Services or Solution Offers, respectively.

By means of studies, the CSIS  supports planners and managers in the task of climate-proofing large scale infrastructure projects and developing a tailored adaptation strategy.

## Study

A study in the context of the CSIS consists of one ore more comparable what-if scenarios that assess the effects of climate change (HxExV), possible adaptation options, their costs and benefits, etc. in relation to a specific project. Thus, a study can be considered a decision aid for project managers, financiers, etc.

A study can for example be used to select the most effective / cost efficient / easy to implement / etc. Adaptation Options to minimise the effects of climate change on a specific project and its Elements at Risk, respectively. 

Such a study is usually conducted in the planning phase of a project. A Study may make use of "virtual" Solution Offers (e.g. a service for creating a tailored Data Package) as well as propose the use of physical Solution Offers (e.g. Adaptation Options) for project implementation.


## A Solution Offer
A Solution Offer is a (generic) product or service that can be advertised in the Marketplace and the CSIS and thus gives Solution Providers the possibility to promote their products and services. 
A Solution Offer can apply to one or more (Economic) Sectors and EU-GL step/modules. 

Solution Offers can consist of different Climate Services  (advice, software) or  represent a distinct Climate Service on their own. The screening tool part of the CSIS is an example of a Solution Offer. Another example would be a service for creating tailored Data Packages.

Additionally, Solution Offers also represent physical products and services like novel reflective materials, CO2-absorbant paint, climate-change-aware construction services, etc. Interestingly, such a physical Solution Offer could be used as Adaptation Option.

## Adaptation Options


Adaptation Options are physical measures, technologies, processes and activities that are applied to reduce the vulnerability of Elements at Risk to climate change and climate variability, thus preventing or alleviating negative effects caused by climate change hazards. 

Simplified IT abstractions of real-world Adaptation Options ("models") are used in CSIS studies to simulate the effects of concrete Adaptation Options. In consequence, Adaptation Option are selected in studies (by means of scenario analysis) and implemented in projects (by means of the respective concrete Solution Offers).

Accordingly, a study in CSIS can be used to promote Solution Offers that qualify as Adaptation Options. 

## Showcase

A Showcase is a concrete application of one or more Solution Offers, e.g. a concrete application of an Expert Service in a specific location or an implementation / usage of a tailored or generic Tool or Product (Climate Service) in a specific location. 

The CSIS Screening Study "Adaptation Scenarios for Metropolitan Resilience Planning in the Naples metropolitan area"  
is a Showcase of the CSIS Screening Tool used in conjunction with a tailored  Data Package (Heat Wave and Pluvial Flood Hazards, Population and Urban Infrastructure Elements at Risk, . etc.).  The usage of a  specific physical product, e.g. painting a 1.000mÂ² wall building with C02-absorbant paint in the city of Rome is another Showcase (of the Solution Offer "C02-absorbant paint product"). More specifically, this particular Showcases demonstrates how the product is actually used as Adaptation Option.
